Mercurial SCM plugin will allow you to manage your repositories for Mercurial from a Clarive instance.

## Requirements

You must have Mercurial installed in the remote server in order to make the commands work properly.

## Installation

To install the plugin, place the cla-mercurial-plugin folder inside the `$CLARIVE_BASE/plugins`
directory in a Clarive instance.

### MercurialRepository

To configurate the Mercurial Server Resource open:

In **Clarive SE**: Resources -> ClariveSE.

In **Clarive EE**: Resources -> Mercurial.

You will be able to save your repository parameters in this CI. The main fields are:

- **Server** - Choose the server CI where you want to manage repository changes.
- **Local path for repository** - Full path for the folder you want to sync with the repository at the server.
- **Repository URL** - URL for the repository that will be managed.

Configuration example:

    Server: Remote_Server
    Local path for repository: /dir/secondDir/workingDir/
    Repository URL: http://exampleRepoURL.com/repoExample

### Parameters

The available parameters for the service are:

- **Command (variable name: command)** - Via this parameter you can choose the main command you wish to launch. Depending on the selected option, you will have different fields to fill out.
The different options to choose from are:
    - add ("add"): add files to be tracked and push then to the reository.
    - status ("status"): check the status of the local files with the repository.
    - log ("log"): print the logs of the repository.
    - diff ("diff"): print the differences between local files and remote ones.
    - branch ("branch"): creates a new branch or prints the current one. When creating a new branch, it will be uploaded to the repository automatically.
    - branches ("branches"): lis all available branches.
    - tag ("tag"): creates a tag and push it to the repository.
    - tags ("tags"): list all the tags.
    - push ("push"): push the changes into the repository.
    - pull ("pull"): download changes from the repository.
    - commit ("commit"): prepare changes files to be uploaded and push them.
    - update ("update"): changes between branches.
    - remove ("remove"): remove files and push changes to the repository.
    - merge ("merge"): combine different branches.
- **Mercurial repository (mercurial_repo)** - Select the Resource with the server and repository you want to manage.

**Only Clarive EE**

- **Errors and Output** - These two fields are related to manage control errors. Options are:
   - **Fail and Output Error** - Search for configurated error pattern in script output. If found, an error message is displayed in the monitor showing the match.
   - **Warn and Output Warn** - Search for the configured warning pattern in script output. If found, an error message is displayed in the monitor showing the match.
   - **Custom** - The the Errors combo is set to custom, a new form is displayed for defining behavior using these fields:
      - **OK** - Range of return code values for the script to have succeeded. No message will be displayed in the monitor.
      - **Warn** - Range of return code values to warn the user. A warn message will be displayed in the monitor.
      - **Error** - Range of return code values for the script to have failed. An error message will be displayed in the monitor.
   - **Silent** - Silence all errors found.

## How to use

NOTE: when adding files, the path is considering you are located at the local working directory of the project.

### In Clarive SE

#### Rulebook

If you want to use the plugin through the Rulebook, in any `do` block, use this ops as examples to configure the different parameters:

Configuration examples:

```yaml
rule: Mercurial demo
do:
   - mercurial_task:
       mercurial_repo: mercurial_resource    # Required. Use the mid set to the resource you created
       command: 'status'       # Required.
```

```yaml
rule: Yet another Mercurial demo
do:
   - mercurial_task:
       mercurial_repo: mercurial_resource    # Required. Use the mid set to the resource you created
       command: 'add'       # Required.
       commit_msg: 'add msg'
       files_paths: ['src/new_file.txt', '/build/another.file']
```

```yaml
rule: Yet another Mercurial demo
do:
   - mercurial_task:
       mercurial_repo: mercurial_resource    # Required. Use the mid set to the resource you created
       command: 'update'       # Required.
       branch_name: 'another_branch'
```

```yaml
rule: Yet another Mercurial demo
do:
   - mercurial_task:
       mercurial_repo: mercurial_resource    # Required. Use the mid set to the resource you created
       command: 'merge'       # Required.
       origin_branch: 'new_branch'
       merging_branch: 'master_branch'
```

```yaml
rule: Yet another Mercurial demo
do:
   - mercurial_task:
       mercurial_repo: mercurial_resource    # Required. Use the mid set to the resource you created
       command: 'tag'       # Required.
       tag_name: 'new_tag'
```

```yaml
rule: Yet another Mercurial demo
do:
   - mercurial_task:
       mercurial_repo: mercurial_resource    # Required. Use the mid set to the resource you created
       command: 'branch'       # Required.
       branch_name: 'new_branch'
```

##### Outputs
